### Fuzzy Connectedness

This repository contains an implementation of the algorithm Fuzzy Connectedness presented in "Fuzzy-connected 3D image segmentation at interactive speeds", A. Falcao, J. Udupa, et al.

There are two implementations:

* Method *run*:  Algorihtm Label Setting ( like version v. 1000 but with Queue instead of d-aryHeap of "Fuzzy-connected 3D image segmentationat interactive speeds", Udupa et al)

* Method *run2*: Algorihtm Label Correcting ( v. 0002 of "Fuzzy-connected 3D image segmentationat interactive speeds", Udupa et al)


The notebook FuzzyConnectednessExperiment.ipynb contains some tests of the algorihtm applied to diffent images with Speckle noise.
